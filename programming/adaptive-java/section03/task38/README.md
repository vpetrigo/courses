Write a lambda expression that accepts two long arguments as a range
borders and calculates (returns) production of all numbers in this
range (inclusively). It's guaranteed that `0 <= left border <= right border`.
If `left border == right border` then the result is any border.

Solution format. Submit your lambda expression in any valid format with ; on the end.

*Examples:* `(x, y) -> x + y; (x, y) -> { return x + y; };`
