Many java developers wrote methods to calculate a factorial value
using a recursive or iterative algorithm. It's time to do it with streams.

The factorial of `n` is calculated by the product of integer number from
`1` to `n` (inclusive). The factorial of `0` is equal to `1`.

**Important.** Use the given template for your factorial method.
Pay attention to type of an argument and the returned value. Please,
don't use cycles or recursion.
