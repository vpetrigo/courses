Write a lambda expression that accepts **seven (!) string** arguments
and returns a string in upper case concatenated from all of them
(in the order of arguments).

*Note.* The correct solution may not work in your
local environment because you don't have suitable
functional interface. The testing system has the
interface and can test your solution.

**Solution format.** Submit your lambda expression with
seven arguments in any valid format with ; on the end.

*Examples (only with two args):* (x, y)  -> x + y; (x, y) -> { return x + y; };

## Sample Input:

The lambda has too many string arguments.

## Sample Output:
