In the Roman numbering system, the following symbols are used to
represent numbers (on the right are the numbers, which correspond
to these symbols in the decimal system):

```
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
```

We use an option in which the numbers `4`, `9`, `40`, `90`, `400` and
`900` are represented by a subtraction of a smaller number from a larger
one: `IV`, `IX`, `XL`, `XC`, `CD` and `CM`, respectively.

Write a program that converts the number from Roman system into the
decimal one.

### Input format:

The string, containing the number, encoded into the Roman numbering
system. It is guaranteed that this number is less than `4000`.

### Output format:

The string, containing the number in the decimal numbering system,
which corresponds to the input.

### Sample Input 1:

```
MCMLXXXIV
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
1984
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
IX
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
9
```

### Sample Input 3:

```
III
```

### Sample Output 3:

```
3
```
