You decided to write a converter from Python code into Java code. 
As CamelCase names are standard in Java, you decided to learn how to convert
names from underscore into this format.

First, write a program, which changes variable names from underscore to the
UpperCamelCase style.

In the underscore style each word starts from a lowercase letter characterizes,
and the underscore character `_` separates the words. In the UpperCamelCase
style each word is starts from the capital letter and there are no separators
between the words.

### Input format:

Single string, containing the name, written in the underscore style.

### Output format:

The string, containing the new name in the UpperCamelCase style.

### Sample Input 1:

```
my_first_class
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
MyFirstClass
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
a
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
A
```

### Sample Input 3:

```
anOther_clAss
```

### Sample Output 3:

```
AnotherClass
```
