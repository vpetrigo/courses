Given an odd number `n`, not exceeding `15`. Create a two-dimensional array
(matrix) from `n×n` elements, by filling it with `"."` symbols (each element of
the matrix is a string containing a single symbol). Then fill the middle row of
the matrix, the middle column, and the main and the secondary diagonals with the
`"*"` symbols. As a result, all `"*"`s in the array must form the star figure.
Output this matrix; elements of the array should be space separated.

### Sample Input:

```
5
```

### Sample Output:

```
* . * . *
. * * * .
* * * * *
. * * * .
* . * . *
