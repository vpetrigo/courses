### MKAD

The length of the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) is `109` kilometers.
Biker Vasya starts from the zero kilometer of MKAD and drives
with a speed of V kilometers per hour. On which mark will he
stop after T hours?

### Input data format

The program gets integers `V` and `T` as input.
If `V > 0`, then Vasya moves in a positive direction along MKAD,
if the value of `V < 0` – in the negative direction.
`0 ≤ T ≤ 1000, -1000 ≤ V ≤ 1000`.

### Output data format

The program should output an integer from `0` to `108` - the mark
on which Vasya stops.
