At some point, you got tired of using the file names with spaces and you have
decided to write a program that renames all files that contain spaces in their
names by replacing the groups of spaces by the underscore symbol `"_"`.

First, you need to write a program that reads the string and replaces the group
of white space characters by underscore symbols.

### Input format:

Single line, containing arbitrary symbols, including spaces.

### Output format:

Modified string.

### Sample Input 1:

```
my file name.txt
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
my_file_name.txt
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
string     with        multi spaces
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
string_with_multi_spaces
```

### Sample Input 3:

```
single
```

### Sample Output 3:

```
single
```
